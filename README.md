# LongPress-UnityEventTrigger
### A tool that allows you to call functions not only when the button is just pressed and released, as with a Unity Trigger - On Pointer, but also every time while the button is pressed.

It is enough to add a LongPressEventTrigger component and specify all the necessary events to trigger in it, as with a default unity button component, and everything will work.

But you can also specify how often events should be triggered when the button is pressed - **tact** paramter (The lower the value, the more often; the higher the value, the less often)
